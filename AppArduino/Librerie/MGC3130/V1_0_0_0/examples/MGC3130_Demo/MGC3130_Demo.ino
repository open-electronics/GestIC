#  v1.0  -  Initial Release
#
#  =============================================================================
#  This is an example and explains how to use the MGC3130 library developed by Matteo Destro for Futura Group srl

#
#  The code for this demo is splitted into four file:
#
#  - MGC3130_Demo   -> Main file project
#  - DigitalInput   -> Contains code to manage digital inputs and the respective functions to manage it
#  - Digital Output -> Contains code to manage digital output and the respective functions to manage it
#  - Timersint      -> Contains code to manage Timer1 of ATMEGA328P. Timer1 generates an interrupt every 2 mSec.
#                      With this resolution (2 mSec) it is possible to manage the timer variables used in this demo.
#                      For example the TimeOut used to filter the unwanted variations on the digital inputs (debouncing)

#  Arduino Uno Rev. 3 (PinOut Arduino to MGC3130 Electrode if is used CN1 connector:
#
#  Line Reset:  Arduino pin 8  ->  Electrode pin 6
#  Line Ts:     Arduino pin 9  ->  Electrode pin 1
#  Line SDA:    Arduino pin 27 ->  Electrode pin 4
#  Line SCL:    Arduino pin 28 ->  Electrode pin 5
#

#
#  If is used "ArdUnoR3_RaspPiB+_GE_100x50 Rev. 1.0" it is possible to connect the ArduinoUno Rev. 3
#  directly to this hardware using the connection on the bottom layer. It is totally compatible with
#  ArduinoUno board R3 and Arduino Leonardo R3
#
#  Note: For this demo is necessary the FT1079K shield developed by Futura Electronica to report the
#        gesture on the digital output (RelÃ¨). In this demo we have used two FT1079K shield
#
#  The gestures reported on the digital output are:
#
#  - Tap South         -> First  FT1079 shield. For digital output it is used the PORTA of MCP23017. Hardware address 0x00, point 0

#  - Double Tap North  -> First  FT1079 shield. For digital output it is used the PORTA of MCP23017. Hardware address 0x00, point 7
#  - Double Tap East   -> Second FT1079 shield. For digital output it is used the PORTA of MCP23017. Hardware address 0x01, point 0
#  - Double Tap Centre -> Second FT1079 shield. For digital output it is used the PORTA of MCP23017. Hardware address 0x01, point 1
#  - West To East      -> Second FT1079 shield. For digital output it is used the PORTA of MCP23017. Hardware address 0x01, point 2
#  - East to West      -> Second FT1079 shield. For digital output it is used the PORTA of MCP23017. Hardware address 0x01, point 3
#  - South to North    -> Second FT1079 shield. For digital output it is used the PORTA of MCP23017. Hardware address 0x01, point 4
#  - North to South    -> Second FT1079 shield. For digital output it is used the PORTA of MCP23017. Hardware address 0x01, point 5
#  - ClockWise         -> Second FT1079 shield. For digital output it is used the PORTA of MCP23017. Hardware address 0x01, point 6
